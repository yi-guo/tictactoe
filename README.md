# tictactoe

A self-written Tic Tac Toe game.

To run the game, simple invoke

  $ python tictactoe_1.x

Note: The game board telling how many times you've won is fake. It'll be my next upgrade.

Version 1.3 Updates:
  - Upgrade to use MINIMAX algorithm for the AI, meaning you have no chance to win!
  - All the files have to be put together to run.

Version 1.2:
  - Make GUI for the game. You can simply click to play.
  - Still rule based AI. Have you won yet?

Version 1.1:
  - User has to enter the corresponding coordinates to "press" a button.
  - Need to play with the coordinate reference table.
  - Rule based AI, which means you have a chance to win if you know how. ;)
